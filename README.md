# Buy Local OR  (buy local Oregon)

This on-going project began during the PDX Code Guild bootcamp that ended May 18th, 2015.
The goal is to create an ecommerce site for Oregon-based artists to be seen/discovered by members of their community.

This application is built on the django 1.7 framework.
