# Buy Local OR  (buy local art)

This is an ongoing project which began as a final project as part of the PDX Code Guild bootcamp that ended May 18th, 2015.
The goal is to create an ecommerce site for Oregon-based artists to be seen/discovered/supported by members of their community.

An artists life is not easy.  Hopefully this app will ease that burden while meeting the needs of those who want an easy method to support those around them.

This application is built on the django 1.7 framework.
